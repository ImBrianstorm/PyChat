# *PyChat*

Chat client server built in Python

## Prerequisites

  * Python 3.x
  * Tkinter

## The Server

The first thing we need is to deploy our server

## The Client

Once we have deployed our server, then we can use our client to enjoy our chat

## The tests

In an attempt to make better software,  I have added a couple of scripts that deploy unit tests, so we can be a little safer that we are making the things right :)

	# To test the server, we must execute the next line
    $ python3 test_server.py
    # And similarly, we execute the next to test the client
    $ python3 test_client.py

These tests are suppossed to test the code and not to throw errors.
